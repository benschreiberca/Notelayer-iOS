# Update Documentation Task

You are updating documentation after code changes.

## 1. Identify Changes
- Check git diff or recent commits for modified files
- Identify which features/modules were changed
- Note any new files, deleted files, or renamed files

## 2. Verify Current Implementation
**CRITICAL**: DO NOT trust existing documentation. Read the actual code.

For each changed file:
- Read the current implementation
- Understand actual behavior (not documented behavior)
- Note any discrepancies with existing docs

## 3. Update Relevant Documentation

- **Project_Changelog.md**: Add entry under a new header with the current date and branch name.
  - Use categories: Added, Changed, Fixed, Security, Removed.
  - Be specific and technical (e.g., "Fixed race condition in TaskEditView").
  - Include files touched and specific logic changes.
- **Project_Release_Notes.md**: Update release notes with user-facing, value-oriented descriptions.
  - Translate technical fixes into benefits (e.g., "Smoother calendar sync" instead of "Fixed state re-render").
  - Aim for 1-2 lines per change, ensuring a new user can understand the value.
  - Maintain a professional, marketing-friendly tone.

## 4. Documentation Style Rules

✅ **Concise** - Sacrifice grammar for brevity
✅ **Practical** - Examples over theory
✅ **Accurate** - Code verified, not assumed
✅ **Current** - Matches actual implementation

❌ No enterprise fluff
❌ No outdated information
❌ No assumptions without verification

## 5. Ask if Uncertain

If you're unsure about intent behind a change or user-facing impact, **ask the user** - don't guess.

## Docs Naming Contract (Required)

- Store project docs under `docs/`.
- Use `Title_Snake_Case` filenames.
- Use feature-oriented naming with explicit doc-type suffixes.
- Preferred format: `<Feature_Or_Domain>_<Doc_Type>[ _YYYY_MM_DD].md`.
- Keep meta docs at top with numeric prefixes:
  - `000_Docs_Start_Here.md`
  - `010_Docs_Features_Hub.md`
  - `020_Docs_Feature_Implementation_Plans_Index.md`
  - `030_Docs_Explorations_Index.md`
  - `040_Docs_Governance.md`
- When creating or renaming docs, update links and these indexes.
