# Execute

Now implement precisely as planned, in full.

Implementation Requirements:

- Write elegant, minimal, modular code.
- Adhere strictly to existing code patterns, conventions, and best practices.
- Include thorough, clear comments/documentation within the code.
- As you implement each step:
  - Update the markdown tracking document with emoji status and overall progress percentage dynamically.

## Docs Naming Contract (Required)

- Store project docs under `docs/`.
- Use `Title_Snake_Case` filenames.
- Use feature-oriented naming with explicit doc-type suffixes.
- Preferred format: `<Feature_Or_Domain>_<Doc_Type>[ _YYYY_MM_DD].md`.
- Keep meta docs at top with numeric prefixes:
  - `000_Docs_Start_Here.md`
  - `010_Docs_Features_Hub.md`
  - `020_Docs_Feature_Implementation_Plans_Index.md`
  - `030_Docs_Explorations_Index.md`
  - `040_Docs_Governance.md`
- When creating or renaming docs, update links and these indexes.
