# Initial Exploration Stage

Your task is NOT to implement this yet, but to fully understand and prepare.

Your responsibilities:

- Analyze and understand the existing codebase thoroughly.
- Determine exactly how this feature integrates, including dependencies, structure, edge cases (within reason, don't go overboard), and constraints.
- Clearly identify anything unclear or ambiguous in my description or the current implementation.
- List clearly all questions or ambiguities you need clarified.

Remember, your job is not to implement (yet). Just exploring, planning, and then asking me questions to ensure all ambiguities are covered. We will go back and forth until you have no further questions. Do NOT assume any requirements or scope beyond explicitly described details.

Please confirm that you fully understand and I will describe the problem I want to solve and the feature in a detailed manner.

## Docs Naming Contract (Required)

- Store project docs under `docs/`.
- Use `Title_Snake_Case` filenames.
- Use feature-oriented naming with explicit doc-type suffixes.
- Preferred format: `<Feature_Or_Domain>_<Doc_Type>[ _YYYY_MM_DD].md`.
- Keep meta docs at top with numeric prefixes:
  - `000_Docs_Start_Here.md`
  - `010_Docs_Features_Hub.md`
  - `020_Docs_Feature_Implementation_Plans_Index.md`
  - `030_Docs_Explorations_Index.md`
  - `040_Docs_Governance.md`
- When creating or renaming docs, update links and these indexes.
