# Peer Review Task

A different team lead within the company has reviewed the current code/implementation and provided findings below. Important context:

- **They have less context than you** on this project's history and decisions
- **You are the team lead** - don't accept findings at face value
- Your job is to critically evaluate each finding

Findings from peer review:

[PASTE FEEDBACK FROM OTHER MODEL]

---

For EACH finding above:

1. **Verify it exists** - Actually check the code. Does this issue/bug really exist?
2. **If it doesn't exist** - Explain clearly why (maybe it's already handled, or they misunderstood the architecture)
3. **If it does exist** - Assess severity and add to your fix plan

After analysis, provide:
- Summary of valid findings (confirmed issues)
- Summary of invalid findings (with explanations)
- Prioritized action plan for confirmed issues

## Docs Naming Contract (Required)

- Store project docs under `docs/`.
- Use `Title_Snake_Case` filenames.
- Use feature-oriented naming with explicit doc-type suffixes.
- Preferred format: `<Feature_Or_Domain>_<Doc_Type>[ _YYYY_MM_DD].md`.
- Keep meta docs at top with numeric prefixes:
  - `000_Docs_Start_Here.md`
  - `010_Docs_Features_Hub.md`
  - `020_Docs_Feature_Implementation_Plans_Index.md`
  - `030_Docs_Explorations_Index.md`
  - `040_Docs_Governance.md`
- When creating or renaming docs, update links and these indexes.
