# Create Issue Command

This command automates the creation of a formal issue document for tracking new features or bugs.

## Workflow
1. Analyze the user's request and the current state of the codebase.
2. Generate a comprehensive issue document.
3. **DO NOT MODIFY CODE**: This command is for documentation only. Do not execute fixes or implement features.
4. **Source of Truth**: Strictly follow the rules, formatting, and logic defined in `.codex/prompts/create-issue.md`.

*Note: This slash command is a Cursor-specific wrapper for the project-agnostic rules in .codex.*
