# Explore Command

This command automates the initial exploration and discovery stage of a new task.

## Workflow
1. Analyze the codebase to understand the current implementation.
2. Identify dependencies, edge cases, and constraints.
3. List ambiguities and questions for the user.
4. **Source of Truth**: Strictly follow the exploration responsibilities defined in `.codex/prompts/explore.md`.
