# Learning Opportunity Command

This command identifies and documents architectural patterns or complex logic for future reference.

## Workflow
1. Identify non-obvious logic or architectural decisions in the code.
2. Document the "Why" and "How" for future learning.
3. **Source of Truth**: Strictly follow the documentation standards defined in `.codex/prompts/learning-opportunity.md`.
