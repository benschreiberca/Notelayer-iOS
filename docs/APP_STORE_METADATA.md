## Description

### Full Description:

**NoteLayer: tasks and notes that actually work the way you do.**

Some days you need to see everything. Other days, just what's due. Sometimes by priority, sometimes by category. NoteLayer doesn't care—it adapts to how you want to see your to-dos that day.

**Four Ways to View Your Tasks**

Switch between views with a simple swipe. See everything in List view, grouped by Priority, organized by Category, or sorted by Date. Drag tasks between categories, change priorities on the fly, or move due dates—all with gestures. The app remembers your preferences, but doesn't force them on you.

**Drag, Drop, Organize**

Drag a task from "House & Repairs" to "Tech & Apps"? Done. Change its priority from Medium to High? Just drag it. Set a due date? Drop it in the "Today" bucket. NoteLayer makes reorganizing your tasks as easy as moving cards around. No menus, no taps—just drag and drop.

**Categories That Make Sense**

Create categories with emoji icons and colors. Or use the defaults: House & Repairs, Tech & Apps, Finance & Admin, Shopping & Errands, and more. Drag tasks between categories to reorganize. Collapse groups you don't need right now. Your categories, your rules.

**Simple Notes**

Capture thoughts quickly. Share them or copy to clipboard. That's it. No folders, no tags, no complexity—just notes when you need them.

**17 Themes (Because Why Not)**

Choose from Barbie, Fast, Iridescent, Arctic, Ocean, Forest, Sunset, Lavender, Graphite, Sand, Mint, Ember, Berry, Citrus, Slate, Mono, or Cheetah. Each theme includes custom colors, backgrounds, and light/dark modes. Pick one that matches your mood. Or your outfit.

**Sync Across Devices**

Sign in with Google, Apple, email, or phone. Your tasks and notes sync instantly across all your devices. Add something on your iPhone, see it on your iPad. Complete a task anywhere, it's done everywhere. Your data lives in the cloud, so you can't lose it even if you try.

**The Details**

Tasks support titles, priorities (High, Medium, Low, Deferred), due dates with times, categories, and notes. Toggle between "Doing" and "Done" views. Collapse groups to focus. Share or copy tasks and notes with context menus. Everything syncs in real-time.

NoteLayer is flexible, fast, and doesn't get in your way. Download it and see your tasks the way you want to see them—today, tomorrow, or whenever you feel like organizing things differently.
