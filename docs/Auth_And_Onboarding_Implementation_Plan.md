# Auth & Onboarding Implementation Plan

**Overall Progress:** `100%` ✅ **BUILD SUCCESSFUL**

## TLDR
Complete authentication UX overhaul: Add non-intrusive welcome page with logo animation, redesign auth UI with consistent styling (Phone → Google → Apple), create Profile & Settings page with sync status, add notification badges to gear icons, and fix Firebase crashes. Make auth seamless, clear, and delightful.

## Critical Decisions
- **Welcome page**: Show once on first launch with 0.5s delay, dismissible forever with "Nah, I don't want to backup" CTA
- **Button order**: Phone → Google → Apple (consistent everywhere)
- **Button style**: Custom rounded buttons with icons, 48pt height (no native Apple/Google buttons)
- **Badge system**: Red dot = not signed in, Yellow dot = sync error, visible on gear icons in both tabs
- **Gear menu**: Global across TodosView and NotesView, replace "Authentication" with "Profile & Settings"
- **Auth state separation**: Move signed-in state OUT of SignInSheet, INTO Profile & Settings page
- **Single auth method**: Prevent linking multiple providers per account
- **Logo animation**: Spin + confetti shatter effect, under 1 second, playful not jarring
