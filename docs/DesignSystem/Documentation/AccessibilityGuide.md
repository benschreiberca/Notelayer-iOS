# Accessibility Guide

## Contrast
- Primary text should maintain AA contrast against backgroundBase.
- Secondary text should remain readable on elevated surfaces.

## Motion
- Prefer subtle animations.
- Respect reduced motion where possible (future hook).

## Color Blindness
- Avoid relying on color alone for selection.
- Use fill + outline or icon markers.
